Cross-session task backlog. Tasks are added here when work started in a session cannot be completed immediately. Each task must be fully self-contained — a fresh agent should be able to pick it up using only the task body and the kb_mcp tools, with no additional context required.

This file is the per-repository instance of the `TODO_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE.md` pattern from the knowledge base. It lives at the root of the working repository alongside `WORKLOG.md` and is intentionally **not registered with kb_mcp** — agents access it via the regular filesystem `Read`/`Edit` tools, not via `knowledge_base_*` calls.

**Agent rules (picking up tasks):**
1. Read each task in full before starting. If its preconditions are unmet, skip it and note the blocker.
2. After completing a task, delete its entire block from this file (from the `---` divider above the `##` header through the `---` divider below the last line of the task body).
3. After completing one or more tasks, assess whether a WORKLOG.md entry is warranted — see Phase 5 of `content/workflows/CODING_AGENT_MAIN_WORKFLOW.md`.
4. Confirm a task is still valid before executing; conditions may have changed since it was written.

**Adding tasks (session authors):**
- Copy the template below (without fences), fill in all fields, and insert it as a new `##` block above the Template section, preceded and followed by `---`.
- Be precise: include target file paths, specific tool calls, expected outcomes, and a verification step.
- Any `knowledge_base_update` call requires a current `content_hash` — capture it with a `knowledge_base_read` at execution time, not when writing the task.

## Task Template

Copy the block below (without the outer fences), fill in all fields, and insert it as a new `## [Task Title]` task block.

**Context:** Why this task exists and what triggered it. Include the KB path or repo file path it operates on.

**Preconditions:** Any state that must be true before starting (prior tasks complete, files present, etc.). Write `none` if there are none.

**Steps:**
1. (Include specific tool calls where possible, e.g., `knowledge_base_read(path="content/...", sections=["..."])`)
2. ...

**Verification:** How to confirm the task is complete (e.g., a grep that should return one match, a status field that should read `done`).

**On completion:** Delete this entire task block from TODO_WORKFLOW.md (from the `---` above the `##` header to the `---` below the last line).
